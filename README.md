# Beremiz (Go Edition)

**Beremiz-Go** is a stack-based toy programming language implemented in **Go**.
It is a reimagining of the original [Beremiz](https://github.com/AdaiasMagdiel/Beremiz) (Lua version), inspired by [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) by [Alexey Kutepov](https://twitch.tv/tsoding).

The goal of Beremiz is **playfulness and education** â€” itâ€™s not intended for production, but to learn about interpreters, compilers, and stack-based language design.

The name **Beremiz** comes from [Beremiz Samir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beremiz_Samir), _The Man Who Counted_, a character created by Brazilian writer [Malba Tahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAlio_C%C3%A9sar_de_Mello_e_Souza).

true if
    "It's true"
else
    "It's false"
endif

writeln
```
