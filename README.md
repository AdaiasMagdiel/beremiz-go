# Beremiz (Go Edition)

**Beremiz-Go** is a work-in-progress port of [Beremiz](https://github.com/AdaiasMagdiel/Beremiz) ‚Äî a stack-based toy language originally written in Lua ‚Äî now being reimplemented in **Go**.

It takes inspiration from [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) by [Alexey Kutepov](https://twitch.tv/tsoding).
The language is designed to be playful and educational, not for production use.

The name **Beremiz** comes from [Beremiz Samir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beremiz_Samir), ‚ÄúThe Man Who Counted,‚Äù a character created by Brazilian writer [Malba Tahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAlio_C%C3%A9sar_de_Mello_e_Souza).
